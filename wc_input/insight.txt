In the past three years, 
over 200 Insight Fellows have become data scientists and data engineers at top-tier companies. 
This coming June, 
the Insight Data Science Fellows Program will celebrate its tenth session in Silicon Valley and its third session in New York City. 
The fourth session of our extremely successful Insight Data Engineering Fellows Program will also take place in June, 
with engineers from varying professional and academic backgrounds building data pipelines using the latest open-
source big data technologies and becoming data engineers on leading teams. 
Over the past six months, 
we have seen intense demand from companies of all sizes and from a variety of industries. 
Heads of data are reaching out to engage with the Insight Fellows on both coasts, 
driven by the high caliber of data projects completed at Insight and the success of our alumni in their new careers.
